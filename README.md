### Introduction

This Challenge is beginner-friendly and available to both Premium and non-Premium users. It consists of 30 daily problems over the month of April. A problem is added here each day, and you have 24 hours to make a valid submission for it in order to be eligible for rewards.


### Rules
In order to be eligible for prizes, you must comply with all the Challenge rules.

1. Valid submission: only problems where a valid submission is made will be eligible for rewards. 
This means the submission was:
a. within the valid time period for that problem; this is before 23:59 PM PT on the day it appeared.
b. made within this Explore Card. If you have completed the question previously, you will need to re-submit an answer within this Explore Card.
c. given the judgement "Accepted" when submitted. Please note that if your submission receives a different judgement, including, but not limited to, Wrong Answer or Time Limit Exceeded, you are allowed to resubmit, as long as it's still within the valid time period.
d. After making a valid submission for a problem, a blue checkmark will appear next to that problem in the left bar. A grey cross means that a valid submission was not made on time for that problem, and so, unfortunately, you're no longer eligible for prizes for that problem.


2. Late or invalid submissions: will not be accepted under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to make a valid submission for a problem within its valid time period, and to confirm that the blue checkmark has appeared.

3. Rewards: only valid submissions will be eligible for rewards. For more information about the rewards, check out the Discuss post.

4. ***Disclaimer**: LeetCode reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to disqualify any entries where we believe a user undermines the fairness of this April's LeetCoding Challenge event, which includes, but is not limited to, copying and pasting solutions from other places directly into your submission.
